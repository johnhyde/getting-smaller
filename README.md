# Getting Smaller (not the real title)
It's a 3D exploration game where you zoom in and discover worlds within worlds

## Demo
Feel free to try out the demo [here](/builds/index.html). There are some things that are still wonky there though, so you might prefer to download the .exe from the builds directory.
I've only built for Windows, since that's what people seem to have most often. If you want to play on Mac let me know and I'll make a build for you (or download the project and build it yourself).

### Controls
WASD for going forward/backward and left/right
Shift/Space for Up/Down (relative to the camera angle)
Enter to save the game
Ctrl+Enter to load the last save
Escape to "pause" the game

## TODO
- make camera movement smooth
- research flying control schemes
- enable different kinds of link activators (raycast, area, inverse area)
- enable dashing with click (?)
- figure out controller controls
- figure out mobile controls
- figure out what the game's about
- do a whole bunch of 3D modeling
- figure out all the colors and materials and shaders
- add a dialogue system?
